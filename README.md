# The Richmond Experience

Welcome to **The Richmond Experience**, a premium barber shop web application built to showcase grooming services in Silicon Oasis, Dubai. This project offers an elegant interface for users to explore services, book appointments, and contact the shop, powered by React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS.

## Overview

The Richmond Experience is designed to provide a seamless online presence for a high-end barber shop. Key features include:

- **Service Showcase**: Display a variety of grooming services with pricing and descriptions.
- **Booking System**: A multi-step booking process to select services, barbers, dates, and times.
- **Contact Page**: A form for customers to get in touch with shop details.
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for desktop and mobile devices using Tailwind CSS.
- **SEO Optimization**: Enhanced with meta tags and structured data for better search engine visibility.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: For building the user interface.
- **TypeScript**: For type safety and better code maintainability.
- **React Router**: For client-side navigation.
- **Tailwind CSS**: For styling with utility classes.
- **Lucide React**: For icons (e.g., clock, map pin).
- **Vite**: As the build tool (assumed based on `main.tsx`).
